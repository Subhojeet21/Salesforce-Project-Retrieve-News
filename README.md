# Case Studies

Get the MOST READ news from bbc.com website.
Since these statistics are internal to BBC and there is currently no API that they have exposed to the outside developers to get these data.
We cannot get the exact data as in website. But have used one API from newsapi.org to find and get the top/popular articles from bbc news.

Other way around is web page scraping which is not recommended at all.
